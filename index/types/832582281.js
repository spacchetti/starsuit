For\nvalues which are expensive to compute, you can either cache them in state\n(as you would with an ordinary Halogen component) or you can use `useMemo`.\n\nAll dependencies used to compute the memoized value should be provided to\nthe `captures` or `capturesWith` function. Consider defining your `useMemo`\nHook in a `where` clause to ensure you don't omit something by accident,\nwhich will lead to stale values.\n\n```purs\n-- before, computed on every render:\nHooks.do\n  x /\\ _ <- Hooks.useState 0\n  y /\\ _ <- Hooks.useState \"\"\n  let expensiveValue = expensiveFunction x y\n\n-- after, computed only if `x` or `y` have changed:\nHooks.do\n  x /\\ _ <- useState 0\n  y /\\ _ <- useState \"\"\n  expensiveValue <- useExpensive x y\n  ...\n  where\n  useExpensive deps@{ x, y } = Hooks.captures deps $ flip Hooks.useMemo \\_ ->\n    expensiveFunction x y\n```\n"}],"tag":"SearchResult"}]
