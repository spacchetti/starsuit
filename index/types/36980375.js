It will not\nrun the second `Run` action (the \"update\") when looping if the given\nduration has not passed since the last update was run.\n\nIt compensates for\nlost time, so that if the duration is a `pure (Milliseconds 10.0)`, and\nthe waiting action alternates between resolving after 12ms and 8ms, when\nthe update is first run after 12ms, `matchInterval` will remember that it\nis 2ms behind, and run the update again when the waiting action resolves\nafter another 8ms. Also, if the waiting action is long enough that 3 times\nthe returned duration has passed since the last update, it will clear the\naccumulated time difference and run the update once. This is so that if\nthe waiting action takes a lot longer to resolve one time, a bunch of\nupdates won't pile up and run in quick succession (otherwise, this can\nhappen if you switch away from a tab when using `delayFrame` as your\nwaiting action, as it will stop updating until the tab becomes active\nagain).\n"}],"tag":"SearchResult"}]
