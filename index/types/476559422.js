A `ResetToken` can be\nused alongside other hook dependencies to force a reevaluation of\nwhatever depends on those dependencies.\n\nFor example, consider an effect or API call which depends on the state\nof a search bar. You may want a button in the UI to refresh stale data.\nIn this case you would include a `ResetToken` in your search effect/aff's\ndependencies and call `useResetToken`'s reset effect in the button's\n`onClick` handler.\n"}],"tag":"SearchResult"}]
