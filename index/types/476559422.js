A `ResetToken` can be\nused alongside other hook dependencies to force a reevaluation of\nwhatever depends on those dependencies.\n\nFor example, an effect or API call which depends on the state of a\nsearch bar with filters. You may want a button in the UI either for UX\nreasons or to refresh possibly stale data. In this case you would\ninclude a `ResetToken` in your search effect/aff's dependencies and\ncall run `useResetToken`'s reset effect in the button's `onClick`.\n"}],"tag":"SearchResult"}]
