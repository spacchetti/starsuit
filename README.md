A "stable Pursuit": generates the documentation for everything from the latest release of [package-sets](https://github.com/purescript/package-sets).

Deployed [here](https://spacchetti.github.io/starsuit/).

## Using as a search engine

In Firefox, create a bookmark with `https://spacchetti.github.io/starsuit/#search:%s` as URL and add  a keyword for it: typing the keyword in the URL bar will let you use the search engine.

In Chrome, use the same URL to create a new search engine in [the settings](chrome://settings/searchEngines).
